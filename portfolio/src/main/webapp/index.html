      <div class="right">
        <p>I am currently a student in the class of 2022 at the University of Pennsylvania and found myself at the intersection between computer science and fine arts, studying in the 
          <a href="http://cg.cis.upenn.edu/dmd.html"> Digital Media Design</a> program at UPENN. At college, I was a teaching assistant for CIS 160, an introductory discrete math course for computer science
          students, and through this experience, I found a new interest in teaching! Last summer, I was a camp instructor for a local summer camp, teaching the cutest middle schoolers introductory computer science topics,
          including game design, intro to python, and solving challenges with VEX IQ robots. I plan to start this fall as a teaching assistant for CIS 460/560, a computer graphics course open to undergraduate and masters students.<br>
          <br>I live in Pittsburgh, PA. I was born in Queens in NYC with my (older) twin sister and grew up with an older brother. We live by a beautiful park that I enjoy to walk, kayak, and ice skate at with friends.<br>
          <br>I love to cook, cross stitch, watch movies, and go on walks with my sister. I recently picked up on embroidery--it's a learning process.<br>
          <br>I hope to spread joy to those around me and share my passions with the world.<br>
