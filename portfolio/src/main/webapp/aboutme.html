      <h1>My story.</h1>
      <br>
        <p>I was born in Queens in NYC with my (older) twin sister and grew up with an older brother. My family moved to Pittsburgh, PA a few years later, 
        and we still live there now! We live by a beautiful park that I like to walk, kayak, and ice skate at. I knew I wanted to study computer science 
        in my senior year of high school, and after graduating from North Allegheny High School in 2018, I joined the 
        <a href="http://cg.cis.upenn.edu/dmd.html"> Digital Media Design </a>
        program at the University of Pennsylvania. In my free time, I like to cook, cross stitch, watch movies, and go on walks.
