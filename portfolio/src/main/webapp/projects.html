      <h2>Poetry Generator (Group Project)</h2>
      <p>Python<br>A neural network trained to generate poetry by fine-tuning <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf">GPT-2</a> on a large dataset of poems.
        Poems can be modified with various inputs, including sampling temperature, title, syllables and characters per line, number of words, number of poems, sentiment, alliteration, and rhyme scheme. While working with 2 others,
        I was responsible for implementing the sentiment and alliteration modifications. We also used <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf>">BERT</a> masking to implement many of the features.

      <h2>The Very Hungry Caterpillar Shader</h2>
      <p>WebGL<br>Rendered with raymarching, inspired by the <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Very_Hungry_Caterpillar/A_xtDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0">children's book</a>. 
        All shapes are 3D primitives represented by signed distance functions with smooth blending or CSG (constructive solid geometry). A depth of field blurring effect is achieved with a post-process gaussian blur linear interpolation. 
        Most of the textures are created procedurally, using 2D/ 3D fractal brownian motion and worley noise. 
        See on <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/tdfBR4">ShaderToy</a>.

      <h2>Monte Carlo Path Tracer</h2>
      <p>C++, OpenGL<br>Full path tracer with direct and global illuminuation. Rays are sampled with multiple importance sampling for estimating direct illumination. I also implemented a full lighting integrator,
        using both direct and global illumination along with russian roulette ray termination. Materials with different BSDFs (specular, fresnel, microfacet) and different light sources (point, area, spot) are supported. Other 
        features include a thin-lens camera and CSG (constructive solid geometry).
