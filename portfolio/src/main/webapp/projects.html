        <h2>Poetry Generator (Group Project)</h2>
        <p>Python<br>A neural network trained to generate poetry by fine-tuning <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf">GPT-2</a> on a large dataset of poems.
          Poems can be modified with various inputs, including sampling temperature, title, syllables and characters per line, number of words, number of poems, sentiment, alliteration, and rhyme scheme. 
          All features are applied to generated poems through post-process methods. While working with David Li and Jake Lem, I was responsible for implementing the sentiment and alliteration modifications. 
          We also used <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf">BERT</a> masking to implement many of the features.

        <h2>The Very Hungry Caterpillar Shader</h2>
        <p>WebGL<br>Rendered in real-time with raymarching, inspired by the <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Very_Hungry_Caterpillar/A_xtDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0">children's book</a>. 
          All shapes are 3D primitives represented by signed distance functions with smooth blending or CSG (constructive solid geometry). A depth of field blurring effect is achieved with a post-process gaussian blur linear interpolation. 
          Most of the textures are created procedurally, using 2D/ 3D fractal brownian motion and worley noise.

        <p>C++<br>Full path tracer with direct and global illuminuation. Rays are sampled with multiple importance sampling for estimating direct illumination. I also implemented a full lighting integrator,
          using both direct and global illumination along with russian roulette ray termination. Materials with different BSDFs (specular, fresnel, microfacet) and different light sources (point, area, spot) are supported. Other 
          features include a thin-lens camera and CSG (constructive solid geometry).

        <h2>Mini Minecraft (Group Project)</h2>
        <p>C++, OpenGL<br>Basic Minecraft interface that allows the user to move around and modify the terrain. Features include: chuncking terrain generation, procedural terrain, game engine update function and player physics, l-system rivers/ caves/ trees, 
          textures with animation, multithreaded terrain generation, biomes, procedurally placed trees, and procedural day and night cycle. I was responsible for chunking terrain generation, texturing, and the day and night cycle.<br><br>
          Chunking (efficient terrain rendering)<br>
          The terrain is rendered using a "chunk" system where blocks of 16 X 256 X 16 are chunked together. Only the hull, or outside faces, of each chunk is rendered, and special cases like empty blocks, edge blocks, and transparent blocks are handled differently.
          A single interleaved VBO is used to store block informationn for more efficient processing. <br><br>
          Texturing<br>
          All textures are loaded in from 1 image file, and UV information for each block type is stored in the VBO. Animated textures, like water and lava, and transparent textures, like ice, are also implemented. A second VBO is used for transparent blocks, 
          since opaque blocks are rendered before any transparent ones.<br><br>
          Procedural sky dome<br>
          The sky dome is implemented in a fragment shader. UV coordinates for a quad are generated through ray casting to sample colors from interpolating between hard coded color palettes that correspond to different time values. The terrain is lit 
          from the rotating sun/ moon.

        <h2>Mini Maya</h2>
        <p>C++, OpenGL<br>Mesh editor based off of <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview?support=ADVANCED">Autodesk Maya</a>. A half-edge data structure is used to support mesh topology editing operations including: splitting edges, triangulating faces, extruding faces, and smoothing mesh by catmull-clark subdivision. 
          Meshes can be loaded in through OBJ files and skeletons through JSON files, where the data is parsed to form a half-edge mesh. The skeleton joints are stored in a scene graph tree, and are interactive through a GUI. 
          I used the skeleton to implement mesh skinning and shader-based skin deformation, where a simple distance based linear blend skinning algorithm is used.
