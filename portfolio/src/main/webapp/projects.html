      <h2>Poetry Generator (Group Project)</h2>
        <p> A neural network trained to generate poetry by fine-tuning <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf">GPT-2</a> on a large dataset of poems.
        Poems can be modified with various inputs, including sampling temperature, title, syllables and characters per line, number of words, number of poems, sentiment, alliteration, and rhyme scheme.
        Also used <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf>">BERT</a> masking to implement many of the modifiable features.

      <h2>The Very Hungry Caterpillar Shader</h2>
        <p> Raymarched scene coded in WebGL, inspired by the <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Very_Hungry_Caterpillar/A_xtDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0">children's book</a>. 
        All shapes are 3D primitives represented by signed distance functions with smooth blending or CSG (constructive solid geometry).
        Implemented procedural texturing, including fractal brownian motion and worley noise.
